### roblox byfron bypass
so as i was playing roblox, I noticed all roblox "cheats" where all down because the new anti cheat roblox ``byfron``.<br>
byfron was auquired by roblox and they paid 11 million for it, some information i learned about byfron is that it was used for fortnite before they had EAC.<br>
So i decided to find a way to bypass byfron and achive ``READ / WRITE`` access to the ``robloxplayerbeta.exe`` process. And after 12 hours of work I found a way.
So how do you bypass byfron on the web version of roblox. Well it's actually easy and with some knowledge about C++ well compiling it you can do it too.

### Compile
Open up ``MVC`` and open the .sln file in the editor, select release and for ``x86`` then hit build.
After go to the build location and open up a cmd window, and run bypass_byfron.exe in a ADMIN CMD WINDOW

### Warning
This just shows how to get more privlages in the process threads, you will have to change up the code to inject a dll after it bypassed the privileges with the current thread
